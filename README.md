# Machine Learning Canvas

The Machine Learning Canvas is a template for developing new or documenting existing predictive systems that are based on machine learning techniques. It is a visual chart with elements describing a question to predict answers to (with machine learning), objectives to reach in the application domain, ways to use predictions to reach these objectives, data sources used to learn a predictor, and performance evaluation methods.

## How to use the html canvas

The text inputs will be automatically persisted in your browser's cache. You can make a copy of the canvas.html file for every project you work on and rename it with the name of your project.

I recommend you occasionally print the html page as pdf as a backup or as a way to share what you've done with others.

## Creating a new version

Open the Machine Learning Canvas HTML file in Safari on Mac OS X, then press
Command-P to print. In the print dialog, check "Print backgrounds" and select
an appropriate scale, so that the entire canvas fits onto one single page.

Finally select PDF, Save as PDF in the bottom left of the screen.

## Publishing on GitHub Pages

In order to publish the HTML version of the canvas on GitHub Pages, e.g. on
`username.github.io/machinelearningcanvas` use following steps:

1. Create a new branch in git named `gh-pages`
2. Whenever changes are made to the `canvas.html` file, merge these changes into the `gh-pages` branch
3. Check the updated published canvas on [username.github.io/machinelearningcanvas/canvas.html](https://trieloff.github.io/machinelearningcanvas/canvas.html)
